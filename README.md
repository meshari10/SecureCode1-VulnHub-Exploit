# SecureCode1 VulnHub Exploit
- Name: SecureCode: 1
- Date release: 23 Feb 2021

SecureCode1 from [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/securecode-1,651/) is a white box pentesting challenege that is similar to machines found in the OSWE exam.

## Vulnerabilities:

1 - Auth Bypass: Exploits blind SQL injection to extract admin token, which allows for password reset of admin account.

2 - RCE via File Upload: There are two ways to do that. The newItem endpoint requires bypassing both blacklisted file extensions and allowed MIME types. The other endpoint is updateItem (the one I used), which only requires bypassing blacklisted file extensions.
